  <p>Moxin was born in China and she traveled to Canada and studied there as a high school student. She spent three years in her high school to look for what she is passionate about. She has done photography, design, ceramics and a little jewelry. Then she came to New York to study communication design at Parsons.</p>

</p>The second link below is to her photography Instagram page. The Instagram account is important to her since it shows how she changed in her way of exploring photography for 2 years. She loves photography and design because she thought it was interesting to discover the beauty/darkness in the world and use creative techniques to show how she thinks about the world and herself.</p>
