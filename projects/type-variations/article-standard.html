      <h1>How To Design Happiness</h1>

      <section class="article">
        <P>Design, at its heart, is about solving problems. That’s why it’s so easy to talk to designers. They can explain exactly how their interface is built to help you navigate through your phone, or how a device was shaped to make it possible for mass manufacturing on the assembly line.</P>

<P>But over the course of hundreds of conversations with designers, I’ve begun to wonder: If most people’s goal is to live a happy life, why did I never hear designers explain how they’d built something to make me happy? At SXSW, I moderated an event called Designing Happiness. Its experts included Bruce Vaughn, former chief creative exec with Disney Imagineering; Gabby Etrog Cohen, senior vice president of PR and brand strategy at SoulCycle; and Randall Stone, director of experience innovation at Lippincott. All three brands strive to create happy experiences, not as an afterthought, but as the first step in what they do. It is an approach that’s paid huge dividends for each company. Here’s what they taught me:</P>
<p class="pull-quote">“HAPPINESS IS MOSTLY THE ANTICIPATION OF AN EVENT AND MEMORY OF IT”</p>
<p>You can never say, “This property is here; it's in this component.” In the case of autopoiesis, you can't say that life &mdash; the condition of being self-produced &mdash; is in this molecule, or in the DNA, or in the cellular membrane, or in the protein. Life is in the configuration and in the dynamical pattern, which is what embodies it as an emergent property</p>
<p>I find it fascinating to apply this same line of analysis to my own mind, in the cognitive domain. My own sense of self, “me,” can be seen in the same light. I have to be relentless to hold on to my identity. These ideas help us to come to a real appreciation of what it means to have an identity &mdash; to comprehend what we think of as our own mind.</p>
<p>My mind has the quality of “being here” so I can relate to others. Foe example, I interact; but when I try to grasp it, it's nowhere &mdash; it's distributed in the underlying network.</p>
